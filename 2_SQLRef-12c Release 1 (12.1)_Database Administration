Hints
Hints are comments in a SQL statement that pass instructions to the Oracle Database
optimizer. The optimizer uses these hints to choose an execution plan for the
statement, unless some condition exists that prevents the optimizer from doing so.

Now Oracle provides a number of tools, including the
SQL Tuning Advisor, SQL plan management, and SQL Performance Analyzer, to help
you address performance problems that are not solved by the optimizer. Oracle
strongly recommends that you use those tools rather than hints. The tools are far
superior to hints, because when used on an ongoing basis, they provide fresh solutions
as your data and database environment change.


Hints should be used sparingly, and only after you have collected statistics on the
relevant tables and evaluated the optimizer plan without hints using the EXPLAIN PLAN
statement. Changing database conditions as well as query performance enhancements
in subsequent releases can have significant impact on how hints in your code affect
performance.


Using Hints
A statement block can have only one comment containing hints, and that comment
must follow the SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, MERGE, or DELETE keyword.
The plus sign (+) causes Oracle to interpret the comment as a list of hints. The plus
sign must follow immediately after the comment delimiter. No space is permitted.

hint is one of the hints discussed in this section. The space between the plus sign
and the hint is optional. If the comment contains multiple hints, then separate the
hints by at least one space.
string is other commenting text that can be interspersed with the hints.
The --+ syntax requires that the entire comment be on a single line.

Oracle Database ignores hints and does not return an error under the following
circumstances:

The hint contains misspellings or syntax errors. However, the database does
consider other correctly specified hints in the same comment.
The comment containing the hint does not follow a DELETE, INSERT, MERGE, SELECT,
or UPDATE keyword.
A combination of hints conflict with each other. However, the database does
consider other hints in the same comment.

Specifying a Query Block in a Hint
You can specify an optional query block name in many hints to specify the query block
to which the hint applies. This syntax lets you specify in the outer query a hint that
applies to an inline view.
The syntax of the query block argument is of the form @queryblock, where queryblock
is an identifier that specifies a query block in the query.
